# Property Management Application

A property management app intended to be used on a desktop.

For each property that is being managed, one will be able to modify the monthly rent, track expenses, 
view the commission they make, and the amount that the owner earns per month. 

The application was coded in Java, and used the JavaFX framework for the front-end development, and a MySQL database was used for the back-end development. 

This project was completed in Summer 2022 to gain more experience working with the JavaFX framework, and to learn how to integrate databases into desktop applications like SQL.
