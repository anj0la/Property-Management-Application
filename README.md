# Property Management Application

A property management application that tracks the rent, expenses and payment of each client's property, along with the commission earned for each property being managed.

The application was coded in Java, used the JavaFX framework for the front-end development, a MySQL database was used for the back-end development, and intended to be used on a desktop.

This project was completed from May 2022 - August 2022 to gain more experience working with the JavaFX framework, and to learn how to integrate databases into desktop applications like SQL.
